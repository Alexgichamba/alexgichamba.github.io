I am a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at CMU (Africa). I am advised by Professor Shinji Watanabe in my research on integrated spoofing robust speaker representations and downstream tasks like speaker verification. Beyond speech, I have other research interests that include:
- Information Retrieval and efficient Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search
- LLMs for knowledge-intensive NLP

Prior to joining CMU, I was pursuing my BSc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Nairobi. I worked on low resource devices for LPWANs advised by Dr. Cosmas Kiruki.

🚀 I will be applying to PhD programs this year hoping to join in Fall 2025!
